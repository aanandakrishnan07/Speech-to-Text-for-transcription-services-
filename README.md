# ðŸ“„ Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project focuses on developing a **speech-to-text transcription system**, primarily using Python libraries such as `librosa`, `transformers`, and optionally `OpenAI Whisper`. The goal is to preprocess, analyze, and eventually transcribe audio data into text â€” useful for building transcription services.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

The notebook installs several key dependencies:

* `kaggle` â€“ for accessing datasets
* `transformers`, `torchaudio`, `librosa`, `noisereduce` â€“ for audio preprocessing and ML model support
* `openai-whisper` â€“ optional transcription model
* `datasets` â€“ for managing and loading structured datasets

Install commands:

```bash
pip install kaggle
pip install transformers torchaudio librosa noisereduce
pip install openai-whisper
pip install datasets
```

## ðŸ“‚ Data Handling

* The user is prompted to upload a `.tar.gz` audio dataset file.
* Audio is loaded using `librosa`, with silence trimmed and volume normalized.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing

* Silence removal: `librosa.effects.trim`
* Audio normalization: `librosa.util.normalize`
* Waveform visualization with `librosa.display.waveshow`

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Analysis

* A spectrogram is generated and displayed for audio signal inspection.
* Intended future analysis: detect accents, identify noise/distortion, and find transcription classification errors.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Status

This notebook appears to be in **early or mid-development**. It includes:

* Installation and data preprocessing steps
* Spectrogram generation
* No trained or evaluated models yet
* No markdown documentation or comments beyond code
